# Cryptocurrencies
##### The purpose of this project was to analyze cryptocurrencies using unsupervised machine learning. A report and visulaization were created that includes the cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for any new investments.
##### The skills used for this project were:
##### 1. Preprocessing data
##### 2. Hierachical clustering and K clustering
##### 3. Reducing dimensions and Principal components
##### 4. Visualizing the data
